### Publish & Depoly

- I use [pengx17/logseq-publish](https://github.com/pengx17/logseq-publish) to publish the Logseq pages and to depoly it to the GitHub Pages (i.e., [yorkjong.github.io/news-digest](https://yorkjong.github.io/news-digest)).
- I also use [Netlify](https://netlify.app) to backup the site to [york-news-digest.netlify.app](https://york-news-digest.netlify.app)
